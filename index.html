        awed and inspired millions, and most importantly still aproaches his task with joy and enthusiasm. Take a look at some of the outstanding art he has created with his art and craft.

        <p>
            I’ve been a designer 25 years and I learn something new with every show, if you don’t, you might as well stop. You’ve got to take the newness that you want and try to get rid of what you don’t want. Usually I have a lot planned before I get to the theatre
            because I’ve seen the set, models and gone through several meetings with the director and set designer about their visions. You’ve got to put all that together into your own vision.
